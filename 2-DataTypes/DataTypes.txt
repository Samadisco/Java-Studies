There are two main types
Primitive and Reference
*int            * string
*double         * array
*char           * object
*boolean


There are even more primitive datatypes including:
byte, short, long, float, void
bytes = 8 bits
short = 16 bits
int = 32 bits
long = 64 bitsfloat = 32 bits
double = 64 bits


Primitive - are simple values stored directly in memory - usually in a location known as stack
Reference - are memeory addresses (stack) that points to the heap.



char - can only contain a single character wrapped in single quotes

REFERENCE 
String = a series of characters wrapped in double quotes

NB: char is wrapped in single quotes and Strings are wrapped in double quotes
